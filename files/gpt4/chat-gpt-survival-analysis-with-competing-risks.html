Yet, there are some
situations where it may not be appropriate to apply the usual
survival methods to the time-to-event analysis. One such situation
is where competing risks are present. The competing risks situation
can be defined in several different ways, as shown in Chapter 3. In
general, a competing risks situation arises when an individual can
experience more than one type of event and the occurrence of one
type of event hinders the occurrence of other types of events. To
illustrate this definition, suppose that a group of patients diagnosed
with heart disease is followed in order to observe a myocardial
infarction (MI). If by the end of the study each patient was either
observed to have MI or was alive and well, then the usual survival
techniques can be applied. In real life, however, some patients
may die from other causes before experiencing an MI. This is a
competing risks situation because death from other causes prohibits
The Kaplanâ€“Meier method in the presence of competing risks 3
the occurrence of MI. MI is considered the event of interest, while
death from other causes is considered a competing risk. The group
of patients dead of other causes cannot be considered censored,
since their observations are not incomplete.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>In this passage, the author is discussing a specific scenario in time-to-event analysis where traditional survival methods may not be suitable. This scenario involves competing risks and masked data.</p><p>Time-to-event analysis, also known as survival analysis, is a statistical method used to analyze the time until an event of interest occurs. The Kaplan-Meier method is one of the most commonly used techniques in survival analysis.</p><p>Competing risks are a situation where an individual can experience more than one type of event, and the occurrence of one type of event prevents the occurrence of other types of events. In the example given, the event of interest is myocardial infarction (MI) in heart disease patients. If patients either experience an MI or remain alive and well by the end of the study, traditional survival analysis techniques, like the Kaplan-Meier method, can be applied.</p><p>However, in real-life scenarios, some patients may die from causes unrelated to MI before experiencing an MI. This creates a competing risk because death from other causes prevents the occurrence of an MI. In this case, the Kaplan-Meier method may not be appropriate.</p><p>The term "masked data" refers to the fact that the group of patients who die from other causes cannot be considered as censored. Censoring is a concept in survival analysis where data for some individuals is incomplete, usually because the event of interest has not yet occurred by the end of the study. However, in this competing risks scenario, the data is not incomplete, but rather "masked" by the occurrence of a competing event (death from other causes). Therefore, traditional survival analysis techniques may not provide accurate results in the presence of competing risks and masked data.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Can you reword the example I posted?</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>In certain cases, traditional survival analysis methods may not be suitable for examining time-to-event data.

When we say that competing risks are "masked," we mean that the true event of interest is concealed or obscured by the occurrence of competing events. In such cases, the traditional censoring concept in survival analysis does not adequately describe the situation.</p><p>Using the example of unemployed individuals, if we know the exact reasons for each participant's unemployment status change (e.g., found a new job, retired, or returned to school), then the competing risks are not masked.

However, the available data may only allow for identifying a subset of possible components responsible for the failure or event, rather than pinpointing the exact cause. This scenario can be generalized to other contexts, such as the time-to-employment status change example.</p><p>When discussing a generalized scenario, you could consider the time-to-event analysis of any system where the event of interest is subject to multiple potential causes that may be obscured or not directly observable. In the context of time-to-employment status change, the event of interest is the change in employment status, and the potential causes (e.g., finding a new job, retirement, or returning to school) may not be explicitly known.</p><p>The primary challenge in such situations is accurately analyzing the time-to-event data when the exact cause of the event is masked or unknown. Traditional survival analysis techniques, like the Kaplan-Meier method, may not provide accurate results due to the presence of multiple potential causes.</p><p>To address this issue, you could explore advanced statistical methods specifically designed to handle masked or competing risks data. These methods could include techniques such as:</p><ol><li>The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which can be used to estimate the unknown parameters in the presence of incomplete or partially observed data.</li><li>Multiple imputation techniques to account for the uncertainty related to masked causes.</li><li>Bayesian approaches, which can incorporate prior knowledge and uncertainty about the potential causes of the event of interest.</li></ol><p>By applying these methods, you can account for the masked component causes in the analysis and improve the accuracy of the results.

Here, the competing risks are finding a new job, retiring, or returning to school. To analyze the properties of each competing risk, you could use the following approaches:</p><ol><li><p>Cause-specific hazard models: This approach estimates the hazard rate for each competing risk separately, assuming that the other risks do not affect the hazard of the risk being modeled. The Cox proportional hazards model can be adapted for this purpose, allowing you to estimate the effects of covariates on each cause-specific hazard.</p></li><li><p>Cumulative incidence function (CIF): The CIF estimates the probability of each competing risk occurring over time. By using CIF, you can estimate the likelihood of each competing event and identify the most common or significant competing risks in the system.</p></li><li><p>Subdistribution hazard models: These models, such as the Fine-Gray model, consider the effect of covariates on the cumulative incidence of each competing risk. By modeling the subdistribution hazard, you can assess the impact of covariates on the occurrence of each competing event while accounting for the presence of other competing risks.</p></li><li><p>Multistate models: In some cases, it may be useful to model the transitions between different states (e.g., employed, unemployed, retired, or in school) using multistate models. These models can provide insights into the probabilities and rates of transitioning between different states, which can help better understand the properties of individual components (competing risks).</p></li></ol><p>By employing these techniques, you can estimate properties of the individual components (competing risks) and gain a deeper understanding of their influence on the overall system.
