Let's discuss it, particularly in relation to large language models that (1) try to predict the next token (in the semi-unsupervised pre-training stage), (2) fine-tuned further with more salient data, like nice algorithmic examples, and (3) some sort of reinforcement learning approach, like RLHF, to further fine-tune with an effort at aligning the outputs to human desire.

The Bitter Lesson
Rich Sutton
March 13, 2019
The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin. The ultimate reason for this is Moore's law, or rather its generalization of continued exponentially falling cost per unit of computation. Most AI research has been conducted as if the computation available to the agent were constant (in which case leveraging human knowledge would be one of the only ways to improve performance) but, over a slightly longer time than a typical research project, massively more computation inevitably becomes available. Seeking an improvement that makes a difference in the shorter term, researchers seek to leverage their human knowledge of the domain, but the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation. These two need not run counter to each other, but in practice they tend to. Time spent on one is time not spent on the other. There are psychological commitments to investment in one approach or the other. And the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods in ways that make them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation.  There were many examples of AI researchers' belated learning of this bitter lesson, and it is instructive to review some of the most prominent.

In computer chess, the methods that defeated the world champion, Kasparov, in 1997, were based on massive, deep search. At the time, this was looked upon with dismay by the majority of computer-chess researchers who had pursued methods that leveraged human understanding of the special structure of chess. When a simpler, search-based approach with special hardware and software proved vastly more effective, these human-knowledge-based chess researchers were not good losers. They said that ``brute force" search may have won this time, but it was not a general strategy, and anyway it was not how people played chess. These researchers wanted methods based on human input to win and were disappointed when they did not.

A similar pattern of research progress was seen in computer Go, only delayed by a further 20 years. Enormous initial efforts went into avoiding search by taking advantage of human knowledge, or of the special features of the game, but all those efforts proved irrelevant, or worse, once search was applied effectively at scale. Also important was the use of learning by self play to learn a value function (as it was in many other games and even in chess, although learning did not play a big role in the 1997 program that first beat a world champion). Learning by self play, and learning in general, is like search in that it enables massive computation to be brought to bear. Search and learning are the two most important classes of techniques for utilizing massive amounts of computation in AI research. In computer Go, as in computer chess, researchers' initial effort was directed towards utilizing human understanding (so that less search was needed) and only much later was much greater success had by embracing search and learning.

In speech recognition, there was an early competition, sponsored by DARPA, in the 1970s. Entrants included a host of special methods that took advantage of human knowledge---knowledge of words, of phonemes, of the human vocal tract, etc. On the other side were newer methods that were more statistical in nature and did much more computation, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Again, the statistical methods won out over the human-knowledge-based methods. This led to a major change in all of natural language processing, gradually over decades, where statistics and computation came to dominate the field. The recent rise of deep learning in speech recognition is the most recent step in this consistent direction. Deep learning methods rely even less on human knowledge, and use even more computation, together with learning on huge training sets, to produce dramatically better speech recognition systems. As in the games, researchers always tried to make systems that worked the way the researchers thought their own minds worked---they tried to put that knowledge in their systems---but it proved ultimately counterproductive, and a colossal waste of researcher's time, when, through Moore's law, massive computation became available and a means was found to put it to good use.

In computer vision, there has been a similar pattern. Early methods conceived of vision as searching for edges, or generalized cylinders, or in terms of SIFT features. But today all this is discarded. Modern deep-learning neural networks use only the notions of convolution and certain kinds of invariances, and perform much better.

This is a big lesson. As a field, we still have not thoroughly learned it, as we are continuing to make the same kind of mistakes. To see this, and to effectively resist it, we have to understand the appeal of these mistakes. We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.

One thing that should be learned from the bitter lesson is the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. The two methods that seem to scale arbitrarily in this way are search and learning.

The second general point to be learned from the bitter lesson is that the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. Essential to these methods is that they can find good approximations, but the search for them should be by our methods, not by us. We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.

According to the article, the most effective AI methods in the long run have been those that rely on massive computation, such as search and learning, rather than human knowledge. Throughout the history of AI, many researchers have attempted to build human-like knowledge and understanding into their models. Although this approach might yield short-term success, it often inhibits long-term progress. The article emphasizes the power of general-purpose methods that continue to scale with increased computation.</p><p>In the context of large language models like ChatGPT, the Bitter Lesson has significant implications. The three stages you mentioned—(1) semi-unsupervised pre-training, (2) fine-tuning with more salient data, and (3) reinforcement learning approaches like RLHF—are consistent with the Bitter Lesson's focus on general methods that leverage computation.</p><ol><li><p>Semi-unsupervised pre-training: This stage involves predicting the next token in a text sequence. By using a massive amount of text data and computational power, the model learns to understand language patterns, grammar, and context. This approach aligns with the Bitter Lesson by prioritizing the leveraging of computation instead of human knowledge.</p></li><li><p>Fine-tuning with more salient data: In this stage, the model is fine-tuned using a smaller dataset, often with specific goals or examples in mind. This process helps the model generalize its understanding and perform better on specific tasks. Although it may seem to incorporate human knowledge, this step still relies heavily on computational power to improve the model's performance.</p></li><li><p>Reinforcement learning approaches like RLHF: The third stage involves using reinforcement learning to further align the model's outputs with human desires. This approach, again, leverages computation by using algorithms that learn from interactions and feedback. This allows the model to adjust its behavior and improve over time, in line with the Bitter Lesson's emphasis on scalable methods based on search and learning.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, the development of large language models like ChatGPT aligns with the principles outlined in the Bitter Lesson. The focus on leveraging computation through general methods such as search, learning, and reinforcement learning allows these models to scale effectively and achieve remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">We don't understand a lot about the human brain.

Our understanding of how consciousness arises remains incomplete, but there are some intriguing ideas and theories that attempt to explain this phenomenon.</p><p>One reason humans struggle to understand consciousness is that it is inherently subjective. Consciousness is the sum of our thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and experiences. As such, it is difficult to objectively study or quantify. Additionally, the brain is an incredibly intricate and sophisticated organ, comprising billions of interconnected neurons, which further complicates our efforts to unravel the mystery of consciousness.</p><p>The idea that our brain processes far more information than we are consciously aware of is a crucial aspect of understanding the nature of consciousness. Our brain is constantly processing and filtering sensory information from the environment, but only a small fraction of this information reaches our conscious awareness. This is because our conscious mind has limited processing capacity, typically estimated to handle only about 3 to 7 variables simultaneously. Consequently, our brain relies on automatic, unconscious processes to handle the vast majority of sensory input and cognitive tasks.</p><p>This limited conscious processing capacity shapes our entire world through a narrow filter, allowing us to focus on what is most important or relevant at any given moment. This selective attention is essential for our survival and daily functioning, as it prevents us from being overwhelmed by the countless stimuli that surround us. However, it also means that our conscious experience represents only a tiny fraction of the information that our brain processes.</p><p>One theory that attempts to explain the relationship between consciousness and the brain's processing capacity is the Global Workspace Theory. According to this theory, consciousness arises when information is distributed across a "global workspace" in the brain, which allows different cognitive processes to share and integrate information. In this view, conscious awareness results from the competition and cooperation of various cognitive processes, with only the most important or salient information reaching the global workspace.</p><p>Understanding the nature of consciousness is not only vital for our comprehension of the human mind but also for the development of artificial intelligence. The question of whether it is possible to create conscious machines remains open, and the answer depends on how well we can understand and replicate the mechanisms that give rise to consciousness in the human brain.</p><p>In conclusion, the nature of consciousness is an enigma that has captivated thinkers for centuries. Our limited conscious processing capacity, combined with the immense complexity of the brain, makes it difficult for us to grasp the full extent of how consciousness arises. As we continue to study the brain and explore various theories, we may gradually unravel the mystery of consciousness and its relationship with the vast underlying cognitive processes that shape our experiences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">I suspect it has that "mysterious" feeling because we can only consciously entertain a few variables at a time, but according to Itegrated Information Theory, are subjective experience is a result of the integration of all of these jointly distributed parts, numbering in the billions.

According to IIT, the level of consciousness in a system is determined by the amount of integrated information it possesses, also known as phi (Φ).</p><p>As you pointed out, our conscious mind can only handle a limited number of variables at a time, while our brain processes billions of pieces of information. This necessitates the creation of abstractions and simplifications to help us navigate the world. Our subjective experience, as described by IIT, is the result of integrating all these underlying processes into a coherent whole.</p><p>The concept of the self can indeed be seen as a simplified abstraction that arises from the complex neural states and cognitive processes that take place within our brains. The self acts as a unifying construct that helps us make sense of our thoughts, feelings, and experiences. By creating a sense of identity and continuity, the self allows us to engage with the world and others in a more manageable way.</p><p>This abstraction process is not limited to the self; our brains are constantly creating abstractions to represent the world around us. We form categories, concepts, and mental models that simplify our understanding of the environment and allow us to make predictions and decisions. These abstractions enable us to interact with the world effectively without being overwhelmed by the immense complexity of the underlying information.</p><p>In conclusion, the "mysterious" feeling associated with consciousness and the self can be partially attributed to our brain's inherent tendency to simplify and abstract the vast amounts of information it processes. Theories like Integrated Information Theory suggest that our subjective experience results from the integration of these distributed neural processes, giving rise to a unified sense of self and conscious awareness.

As we continue to study the brain and human cognition, we may uncover new insights that help us better understand these intricate processes.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Can you simplify and develop everything we've talked about here so that it's fit to post on twitter?</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>Exploring consciousness: our limited working memory creates simple models to navigate daily life, but this inductive bias may hinder understanding complex phenomena like consciousness itself. #consciousness #cognition #inductivebias</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Modify the tweet by incorporating the idea that GPT-X may help us to understand ourselves.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>GPT-X may aid in understanding consciousness: our limited working memory forms simple models for daily life navigation, but this inductive bias complicates grasping complex phenomena like consciousness itself. #consciousness #cognition #inductivebias #GPTX</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Modify the tweet again.
