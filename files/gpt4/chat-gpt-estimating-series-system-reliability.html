title: "Estimating the reliability of components in a series systems from masked failure data"
author: "Alex Towell"
abstract: "We estimate the reliability of series systems from masked
failure data consisting of right-censored system lifetimes and masked
component cause of failures. Under a minimal set of conditions that permit
us to ignore how the component cause of failures are masked, we estimate the
sampling distribution of the MLE in a variety of situations. We find that as
long as the masking does not always include a particular component as a
potential cause of failure whenever another component is also a potential
cause, the MLE is unique and consistent. However, this is often not a realistic
situation in industrial settings. For example, a system may be repaired by
replacing an entire circuit board consisting of multiple components, in which
case whenever one of the components on that circuit board fails, all of the
components on the circuit board are potential component causes of failure.
In this case, we have a non-unique MLE, which provides less information
about the reliability of the series system and its components."

Introduction
============
Accurate reliability specifications of components of a multi-component system,
such as mean time to failure (MTTF), can be quite valuable.
For instance, such information may be used to help identify the component cause
of system failure.
However, this information is often not available, or if it is available, it may
not be very accurate.
In this case, we may try to estimate the reliability of each component from
system failure data.

We are interested in estimating the reliability of  *series systems*.
In a series system, the system fails whenever any of its components fail.
The famous statistician George Box once opined that all models are wrong, but some
are useful, meaning that a theoretical model of real phenomenon is
incapable of representing its exact behaviour, but it may still be useful.
Indeed, sometimes it is even more useful, since a simplified model is more
understandable and only includes the most salient features.

Since many real-world systems are greatly impaired whenever a set of
its *critical* components fail, the series system model is often a very *useful*
approximation of its internal structure.
For example, people in a particular experiment may be regarded as series systems
where the components are some relevant set of vital organs. This model is
often a very useful abstraction that averages over many complicated, unobserved
details that may only have a small effect on an average person's lifespan.

In this paper, the experimental unit is a particular type of series system that
consists of $m$ components and we seek to estimate the reliability of the
components from *masked data* where we observe only partial information about
the system, e.g., the component lifetimes are masked (not observed in the sample).

We imagine that we conduct an experiment where we obtain the lifetimes
of the $m$ components, which has a sample space $(0,\infty)^m$.
An observed result is called an *outcome* of the experiment, e.g.,
$(1.2,0.5,1.1)$.
However, we assume that this data is masked in the following ways:

1. The experiments may be right-censored, which means that the experiment or
   observation may be suspended before the system fails.

2. We can only observe the lifetime of the component with the minimum
   lifetime. This constraint is imposed by the fact that the system
   is arranged in series and thus stops working whenever one of the components
   fails.
   
3. It may not be easy or possible to identify the failed component. We consider
   the case where we can only observe a set of components that includes the
   failed component. We refer to this set of components as the candidate set.\footnote{
   If the candidate set has only a single component, then we know the exact
   component cause of failure.}
   
   This constraint may be due to a variety of reasons.
   A canonical example is given by supposing that when the series system fails,
   it is repaired by simultaneously replacing some subset of the components,
   thus preventing isolating the specific failed component.
   
We take a random sample of $n$ such experiments, where the right-censored
system lifetimes are i.i.d. when conditioned on the right-censoring time, but
the candidate sets are not assumed to be independent but not necessarily
identically distributed.
In later sections, we consider a set of realistic conditions that allow us to
ignore the distribution of candidate sets, which allows us to construct a
reduced likelihood function for the masked failure data. Finally, we find the
MLE $\hat{\v\theta}$ that maximizes the reduced likelihood function, which is
the same MLE for "full" likelihood function where we know the distribution of
candidate sets.

Statistical model {#sec:statmod}
===============================
Consider a system with $m$ components, indexed by $1,2,\ldots,m$.
Each component only has two possible states, *failed* and *functioning*.
The state of the system also only has two possible states, *failed*
and *functioning*.
The lifetime of a system is the elapsed time from when the new, functioning
system is put into operation until it fails for the *first time*.
We are not interested in what happens to a system after it fails, e.g., we do
not consider repairing systems and putting them back into operation under
further observation.

A system that is in a functioning state if and only if at least $k$
of the $m$ components are in a functioning state is denoted a $k$-out-of-$m$
system.
We narrow our scope to $m$-out-of-$m$ systems, also known as *series systems*.
A series system is functioning if and only if every component is functioning.
Consequently, in a series system, precisely one component is the cause of
failure.

Our sample consists of lifetime data for i.i.d. series systems.
Since the component lifetimes are subject to chance variations, we denote the
lifetime of the $j$\textsuperscript{th} component of the $i$\textsuperscript{th}
system by the random variable $T_{i j}$.
We assume that the $m$ component lifetimes, $T_{i 1},\ldots,T_{i m}$, are
statistically independent and non-identical.
In a series system, whenever any component fails, the system fails.
Thus, the lifetime of the $i$\textsuperscript{th} system, $\T_i$, is given by
the component with the smallest lifetime,
$$
    \T_i = \min\bigr\{T_{i 1},T_{i 2}, \ldots, T_{i m} \bigr\}.
$$

We assume that the component lifetimes may be adequately modeled by some
parametric probability distribution.
In what follows, matrices and vectors are denoted in boldface, e.g., $\v{x}$ is
a vector.
The $i$\textsuperscript{th} column and $(i,j)$-th element of a matrix $\v{A}$
is denoted respectively by $\v{A_j}$ and $\v{A}_{i j}$.
We let $\v{\theta_j}$ denote the parameter vector of the $j\textsuperscript{th}$
component, and each $\v{\theta_j}$ for $j=1,\ldots,m$ may be different sizes.
We define the parameter vector of the entire series system by
$$
    \v\theta = (\v{\theta_1},\ldots,\v{\theta_m}).
$$

The cumulative distribution function (cdf) for a random varible $T$ is given by
\begin{equation}
 F_T(t) = \Pr\{T \leq t\},
\end{equation}
where $\Pr\{T \in E\}$ denotes the probability that a random variable $T$
realizes a value in $E$.
The probability density function (pdf) for a continuous random varible $T$ is
given by
\begin{equation}
f_T(t) = \frac{d}{dt} F_T(t).
\end{equation}
If a random variable $T$ has a parametric distribution indexed by a
parameter vector $\v\beta$, we denote its pdf by $f_T(t;\v\beta)$ and likewise
for other distribution functions, e.g., the $i$\textsuperscript{th} series
system has a cdf denoted by $F_{\T_i}(t;\v{\theta})$.
In the case of the lifetime distribution functions of components, we subscript
the distribution functions by component index instead of the symbol for the
random variable, e.g., the cdf of the $j$\textsuperscript{th} component for the
$i$-th system is denoted by $F_j(t;\v{\theta_j})$ instead of
$F_{T_{i j}}(t;\v{\theta_j})$.
If it is clear from the context which random variable a distribution
function is for, we may drop the subscripts, e.g., $F(t)$ instead of $F_T(t)$.
Finally, as an abuse of notation, we often write a function as $f(t)$ when we
really mean that $f$ is a function of variable $t$.

There are two particularly important functions in survival analysis, the
survival function and the hazard function.
\begin{definition}
The survival function, $R_T(t)$, of a random lifetime $T$ is the
probability that it realizes a value larger than some specified duration of time $t$,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
R_T(t) &amp;= \Pr\{T &gt; t\}\\
     &amp;= 1 - F_T(t).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
In other words, $R_T(t)$ denotes the probability that $T$ survives longer than
$t$.
\end{definition}

The hazard function is a bit more subtle. For a random lifetime $T$, the
probability that a failure occurs between $t$ and $\Delta t$ given that no
failure occurs before time $t$ is given by
$$
\Pr\{T \leq t+\Delta t|T &gt; t\} = \frac{\Pr\{t &lt; T &lt; t+\Delta t\}}{\Pr\{T &gt; t\}}.
$$
The *failure rate* is given by the above divided by the length of the time
interval, $\Delta t$:
$$
\frac{\Pr\{t &lt; T_{i j} &lt; t+\Delta t\}}{\Delta t} \frac{1}{\Pr\{T_{i j} &gt; t\}} =
    \frac{R_j(t;\theta_j) - R_j(t+\Delta t;\theta_j)}{R_j(t)}.
$$
\begin{definition}
\label{def:failure_rate}
The hazard function $h_T(t)$ for a continuous random variable $T$ is the
instantaneous failure rate at time $t$, which is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:failure_rate}
\begin{split}
h_T(t) &amp;= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Pr\{t &lt; T &lt; t+\Delta t\}}{\Delta t} \frac{1}{\Pr\{T &gt; t\}}\\
       &amp;= \frac{f_T(t)}{R_T(t)}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ have a joint pdf $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$.
Given the joint pdf $f(x,y)$, the marginal pdf of $X$ is given by
$$
f_X(x) = \int_{\mathcal{Y}} f_{X,Y}(x,y) dy,
$$
where $\mathcal{Y}$ is the support of $Y$. (If $Y$ is discrete, replace
the integration with a summation over $\mathcal{Y}$.)

The conditional pdf of $Y$ given $X=x$, $f_{Y|X}(y|x)$, is defined as
$$
f_{X|Y}(y|x) = \frac{f_{X,Y}(x,y)}{f_X(x)}.
$$
We may generalize all of the above to more than two random variables, e.g.,
the joint pdf of $X_1,\ldots,X_m$ is denoted by $f(x_1,\ldots,x_m)$.

## Masked data {#sec:data}
The object of interest is the (unknown) parameter value $\v\theta$. 
To estimate $\v\theta$, we need *data*.
In general, there are three types of life data: exact lifetime,
interval lifetime (where the lifetime is known to have occurred
between two points in time), and right censored data, where the suspension time
of the experiment is reached before the system fails.

In this paper, we limit our focus to exact lifetimes and right censored data.
In particular, we consider a sample of $n$ i.i.d. series systems, each of
which is put into operation at some time and and observed until either it fails
or is right-censored.
We denote the fixed right-censoring time by $\tau$.
Whether the $i$\textsuperscript{th} system is right-censored is a random
variable defined as $\delta_i = 1_{\{\tau_i &lt; \T_i\}}$ where
$\delta_i = 1$ indicates right-censoring.
The right-censored time of the $i$\textsuperscript{th} system in the
sample, $S_i$, is given by
\begin{equation}
S_i = \min\{\T_i,\tau_i\}
\end{equation}
and the indicator for right censoring, $\delta_i$, is given by
\begin{equation}
\delta_i = 1_{\T_i &gt; \tau_i}.
\end{equation}

We also have masked data about the component cause of failure in
the form of candidate sets.
A candidate set consists of some subset of component indices that plausibly
contain the index of the failed component.
The sample space of candidate sets are all subsets of $\{1,\ldots,m\}$, with the
exception of the empty set (thus there are $2^m - 1$ possible outcomes in the
sample space).
If a series system is right-censored ($\delta_i = 1$), then all of the
components are in the candidate set.
We typically denote the candidate set corresponding to the
$i$\textsuperscript{th} system in the sample by $c_i$.
Since the data generating process for candidate sets may be subject to chance
variations, we model it as a random set $\mathcal{C}_i$.
We may also view $\mathcal{C}_i$ as a random Boolean vector $X_{i 1},\ldots,X_{i m}$
where $X_{i j}=1$ denotes that the $j$\textsuperscript{th} component is in the
observed candidate set $c_i$.

We let $\{a_i\}_{i \leq k}$ denote the sequence $a_1,\ldots,a_k$. If it is
clear from the context, we may also use $\{a_i\}$.
The random sample of masked data is give by
$$
    \{(S_i,\delta_i,\mathcal{C}_i)\}_{i \leq n},
$$
where $\mathcal{C}_i$ is the random candidate set, $S_i$ is the right-censored
lifetime, and $\delta_i$ is the indicator for right-censoring for
the $i$\textsuperscript{th} series system.
We show a graphical model of how the masked data is generated in Figure
\ref{fig:figureone}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering{
\resizebox{0.5\textwidth}{!}{\input{./image/dep_model.tex}}}
\caption{Dependency graph of the generative model for $(S_i,\delta_i,\mathcal{C}_i)$.
The elements in green are observed in the sample, while the elements in red
are unobserved. We see that $\mathcal{C}_i$ is a related to both the unobserved
component lifetimes $T_{i 1},\ldots,T_{i m}$ and other unknown and unobserved
covariates, like ambient temperature or the particular diagnostician who
generated the candidate set. These two complications for $\mathcal{C}_i$ are
why we in later sections seek a way to construct a reduced likelihood function
that is not a function of the distribution of $\mathcal{C}_i$.}
\label{fig:figureone}
\end{figure}

An example of masked data for exact, right-censored system failure times with
candidate sets that mask the component cause of failure can be seen in Table 1
for an $3$-out-of-$3$ series system.

Series system lifetime {#sec:ttf}
=================================
The reliability function of the series system is given by the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:sys_reliability_function}
The series system has a reliability function given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sys_reliability_function}
  R(t;\v\theta) = \prod_{j=1}^m R_j(t;\v{\theta_j}).
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The reliability function is defined as
$$
  R(t;\v\theta) = \Pr\{\T_i &gt; t\}
$$
which may be rewritten as
$$
  R(t;\v\theta) = \Pr\{\min\{T_{i 1},\ldots,T_{i m}\} &gt; t\}.
$$
For the minimum to be larger than $t$, every component must be larger than $t$,
$$
  R(t;\v\theta) = \Pr\{T_{i 1} &gt; t,\ldots,T_{i m} &gt; t\}.
$$
Since the component lifetimes are independent, by the product rule the above may
be rewritten as
$$
  R(t;\v\theta) = \Pr\{T_{i 1} &gt; t\} \times \cdots \times \Pr\{T_{i m} &gt; t\}.
$$
By definition, $R_j(t;\v\theta) = \Pr\{T_{i j} &gt; t\}$.
Performing this substitution obtains the result
$$
  R(t;\v\theta) = \prod_{j=1}^m R_j(t;\v{\theta_j}).
$$
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:sys_pdf}
The random system lifetime $\T_i$ has a pdf given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sys_pdf}
f(t;\v\theta) = \sum_{j=1}^m f_j(t;\v{\theta_j})
    \prod_{\substack{k=1\\k\neq j}}^m R_k(t;\v{\theta_j}).
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By definition, the pdf may be written as
$$
    f(t;\v\theta) = -\frac{d}{dt} \prod_{j=1}^m R_j(t;\v{\theta_j}).
$$
By the product rule, this may be rewritten as
\begin{align*}
  f(t;\v\theta)
    &amp;= -\frac{d}{dt} R_1(t;\v{\theta_1})\prod_{j=2}^m R_j(t;\v{\theta_j}) -
      R_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) \frac{d}{dt} \prod_{j=2}^m R_j(t;\v{\theta_j})\\
    &amp;= f_1(t;\v\theta) \prod_{j=2}^m R_j(t;\v{\theta_j}) -
      R_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) \frac{d}{dt} \prod_{j=2}^m R_j(t;\v{\theta_j}).
\end{align*}
Recursively applying the product rule $m-1$ times results in
$$
f(t;\v\theta) = \sum_{j=1}^{m-1} f_j(t;\v{\theta_j})
    \prod_{\substack{k=1\\k \neq j}}^m R_k(t;\v{\theta_k}) -
    \prod_{j=1}^{m-1} R_j(t;\v{\theta_j}) \frac{d}{dt} R_m(t;\v{\theta_m}),
$$
which simplifies to
$$
f(t;\v\theta)= \sum_{j=1}^m f_j(t;\v{\theta_j})
    \prod_{\substack{k=1\\k \neq j}}^m R_k(t;\v{\theta_k}).
$$
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:sys_failure_rate}
The system lifetime $\T_i$ has a hazard function function given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sys_failure_rate}
  h(t;\v\theta) = \sum_{j=1}^m h_j(t;\v{\theta_j}).
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The $i$\textsuperscript{th} series system lifetime has a hazard function defined as
$$
  h(t;\v\theta) = \frac{f_{\T_i}(t;\v\theta)}{R_{\T_i}(t;\v\theta)}.
$$
Plugging in expressions for these functions results in
$$
  h(t;\v\theta) = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^m f_j(t;\v{\theta_j})
    \prod_{\substack{k=1\\k \neq j}}^m R_k(t;\v{\theta_k})}
      {\prod_{j=1}^m R_j(t;\v{\theta_j})},
$$
which can be simplified to
\begin{align*}
h_{T_i}(t;\v\theta)
    &amp;= \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{f_j(t;\v{\theta_j})}{R_j(t;\v{\theta_j})}\\
    &amp;= \sum_{j=1}^m h_j(t;\v{\theta_j}).
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

By definition,
$$
h(t;\v\theta) = \frac{f(t;\v\theta)}{R(t;\v\theta)},
$$
and thus
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sys_pdf_2}
\begin{split}
f(t;\v\theta) &amp;= h(t;\v\theta) R(t;\v\theta)\\
              &amp;= \bigl\{\sum_{j=1}^m h_j(t;\v{\theta_j})\bigr\}
                 \bigl\{ \prod_{j=1}^m R_j(t;\v{\theta_j}) \bigr\},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
which we find to be a more convenient form than Equation \eqref{eq:sys_pdf}.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>This section presents a series of three theorems and their proofs, which are related to the reliability, probability density function (pdf), and hazard function of a series system lifetime.

Component cause of failure {#sec:comp_cause}
============================================
If a series system failed at time $t$, precisely one of the components failed at
time $t$.
We model the component cause of the series system failure as a random variable.
\begin{definition}
The component cause of failure of the $i$\textsuperscript{th} series system is
denoted by the random variable $K_i$ whose support is given by $\{1,\ldots,m\}$.
For example, $K_i=j$ indicates that the component indexed by $j$ failed first, i.e.,
$$
    T_{i j} &lt; T_{i j'}
$$
for every $j'$ in the support of $K_i$ except for $j$.
Since we have series systems, $K_i$ is unique.
\end{definition}
Note that a more succinct way to define $K_i$ is given by
$$
K_i = \operatorname{argmin}_j \bigl\{ T_{i j} : j \in \{1,\ldots,m\}\bigr\}.
$$

The system lifetime and the component cause of failure has a joint distribution
given by the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:f_k_and_t}
The joint pdf of the component cause of failure $K_i$ and series system lifetime
$\T_i$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:f_k_and_t}
  f_{K_i,T_i}(j,t;\v\theta) = h_j(t;\v{\theta_j}) R_{\T_i}(t;\v\theta),
\end{equation}
where $h_j(t;\v{\theta_j})$ is the hazard function of the $j$\textsuperscript{th}
component and $R_{\T_i}(t;\v\theta)$ is the reliability function of the series
system.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider a $3$-out-of-$3$ system.
By the assumption that component lifetimes are mutually independent,
the joint pdf of $T_{i 1},T_{i 2},T_{i 3}$ is given by
$$
    f(t_1,t_2,t_3;\v\theta) = \prod_{j=1}^{3} f_j(t;\v{\theta_j}).
$$
The first component is the cause of failure at time $t$ if $K_i = 1$ and
$T_i = t$, which may be rephrased as the likelihood that $T_{i 1} = t$,
$T_{i 2} &gt; t$, and $T_{i 3} &gt; t$. Thus,
\begin{align*}
f_{K_i,T_i}(j;\v\theta) 
    &amp;= \int_t^{\infty} \int_t^{\infty}
        f_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) f_2(t_2;\v{\theta_2}) f_3(t_3;\v{\theta_3})
        dt_3 dt_2\\
     &amp;= \int_t^{\infty} f_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) f_2(t_2;\v{\theta_2})
        R_3(t;\v{\theta_3}) dt_2\\
     &amp;= f_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) R_2(t;\v{\theta_2}) R_3(t_1;\v{\theta_3}).
\end{align*}
Since $h_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) = f_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) / R_1(t;\v{\theta_1})$,
$$
f_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) = h_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) R_1(t;\v{\theta_1}).
$$
Making this substitution into the above expression for $f_{K_i,T_i}(j,t;\v\theta)$
yields
\begin{align*}
f_{K_i,T_i}(j,t;\v\theta)
    &amp;= h_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) \prod_{l=1}^m R_l(t;\v{\theta_l})\\
    &amp;= h_1(t;\v{\theta_1}) R(t;\v{\theta}).
\end{align*}
Generalizing from this completes the proof.
\end{proof}

If random variable $X$ is discrete, then its probability mass function (pmf) $f$
is given by$f(x) = \Pr\{X = x\}$.
The conditional distribution of the component cause of failure given a series system
lifetime is given by the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:f_given_s_form_2}
The conditional pmf of the component cause of failure $K_i$ given a series system
lifetime $\T_i=t$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:f_given_s_form_2}
    f(k;\v\theta|t) = \frac{h_k(t;\v{\theta_k})}{h(t;\v\theta)}.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The random variables $K_i$ and $\T_i$ have the joint pdf $f(k,t;\v\theta)$, and thus
the conditional pdf of $K_i$ given $\T_i=t$ may be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:f_given_s_form_2_part1}
    f(k;\v\theta|t) = \frac{f(k,t;\v\theta)}{f(t;\v\theta)}.
\end{equation}
From Equation \eqref{eq:f_k_and_t},
$f(k,t;\v\theta) = h_k(t;\v{\theta_k}) R(t;\v\theta)$,
and from Equation \eqref{eq:sys_pdf_2},
$f(t;\v\theta) = h(t;\v{\theta}) R(t;\v\theta)$.
Making these substitutions into the above Equation \eqref{eq:f_given_s_form_2_part1}
results in
$$
f(k;\v\theta|t) =
    \frac{h_k(t;\v{\theta_k}) R(t;\v\theta)}
         {h(t;\v\theta) R(t;\v\theta)},
$$
which simplifies to
$$
f(k;\v\theta|t) = \frac{h_k(t;\v{\theta_k})}{h(t;\v\theta)}.
$$
\end{proof}

The conditional distribution of the series system lifetime given a particular
component cause of failure is given by the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}
The conditional pdf of system failure time $\T_i$ given component cause of
failure $K_i=j$ is given by
\begin{equation}
f_{\T_i|K_i}(t;\v{\theta}|j) =
    \frac{h_j(t;\v{\theta_j}) R(t;\v\theta)}
         {E_{\v\theta}\bigl\{ f_{K_i|T_i}(j;\v\theta|T_i)\bigr\}}.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The conditional pdf of $T_i$ given $K_i = j$ may be written as
$$
f_{\T_i|K_i}(t;\v{\theta}|j) =
    \frac{f_{\T_i,K_i}(t,j;\v\theta)}
         {f_{K_i}(j;\v\theta)}.
$$
The marginal distribution of $K_i$ has a pmf given by
\begin{align*}
f_{K_i}(j;\v\theta)
    &amp;= \int_{0}^{\infty} f_{K_i,T_i}(j,t;\v\theta) dt\\
    &amp;= \int_{0}^{\infty} h_j(t;\v{\theta_j}) R(t;\v\theta) dt.
\end{align*}
Since $h(x) = f(x)/R(x)$, $R(x)=f(x)/h(x)$, and thus
\begin{align*}
f_{K_i}(j;\v\theta)
    &amp;= \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{h_j(t;\v{\theta_j})}{h(t;\v\theta)} f(t;\v\theta) dt\\
    &amp;= E_{\v\theta}\bigl\{ f_{K_i|T_i}(j;\v\theta|T_i)\bigr\}.
\end{align*}
Plugging the marginal pmf for $K_i$ into the above equation for $f_{T_i|K_i}(t;\v\theta|j)$
obtains the result
$$
f_{T_i|K_i}(t;\v\theta|j) =
    \frac{h_j(t;\v{\theta_j}) R(t;\v\theta)}
         {E_{\v\theta}\bigl\{ f_{K_i|T_i}(j;\v\theta|T_i)\bigr\}}.

It presents various theorems and proofs related to the joint distribution of the component cause of failure ($K_i$) and series system lifetime ($\T_i$), as well as the conditional distribution of $K_i$ given a series system lifetime and the conditional distribution of system failure time given a particular component cause of failure.</p><p>The component cause of failure of the $i$-th series system is represented by the random variable $K_i$. Theorem \ref{thm:f_k_and_t} gives the joint probability density function (pdf) of $K_i$ and $\T_i$ as $f_{K_i,T_i}(j,t;\v\theta) = h_j(t;\v{\theta_j}) R_{\T_i}(t;\v\theta)$, where $h_j(t;\v{\theta_j})$ is the hazard function of the $j$-th component and $R_{\T_i}(t;\v\theta)$ is the reliability function of the series system. The proof for this theorem is provided by considering a 3-out-of-3 system and making use of the assumption that component lifetimes are mutually independent.</p><p>Theorem \ref{thm:f_given_s_form_2} states the conditional probability mass function (pmf) of the component cause of failure $K_i$ given a series system lifetime $\T_i=t$. It is given by $f(k;\v\theta|t) = \frac{h_k(t;\v{\theta_k})}{h(t;\v\theta)}$. The proof for this theorem is derived by using the joint pdf $f(k,t;\v\theta)$.</p><p>Lastly, the text provides a theorem on the conditional distribution of the series system lifetime given a particular component cause of failure. It states that the conditional pdf of system failure time $\T_i$ given component cause of failure $K_i=j$ is given by $f_{\T_i|K_i}(t;\v{\theta}|j) = \frac{h_j(t;\v{\theta_j}) R(t;\v\theta)}{E_{\v\theta}\bigl{ f_{K_i|T_i}(j;\v\theta|T_i)\bigr}}$. The proof for this theorem is derived by utilizing the marginal pmf for $K_i$.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div></body></html>
