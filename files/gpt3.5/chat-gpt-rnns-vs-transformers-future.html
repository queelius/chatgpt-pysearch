In a transformer, each token in the input sequence is associated with a set of weights that determine the importance of other tokens in the sequence when computing the representation of that token. This allows the model to selectively focus on certain parts of the input when making predictions, which makes it more adaptable to different tasks.</p><p>In contrast, RNNs use a recurrent hidden state to maintain information about the input sequence as it is processed token by token. This hidden state is updated at each time step based on the current input and the previous hidden state. While RNNs can also be fine-tuned, they typically require more data and computational resources to achieve similar performance as transformer-based models.</p><p>Another important difference is that transformer models can be pre-trained on a large corpus of data and then fine-tuned on a task-specific dataset with a small number of examples, which is known as transfer learning. This allows to benefit from the pre-trained weights and save computational resources and time.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">What are RNNs better at?</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are better suited for tasks that involve sequential data and have temporal dependencies.
