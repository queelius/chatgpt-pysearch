The failure rate function, also known as the hazard function, describes the instantaneous probability of failure at a given time, given that the system has not failed yet.</p><p>Assuming a parametric model, such as Weibull distribution, for the components of the system is also a good choice. The Weibull distribution is a widely used model for describing the lifetime of systems, and it has been used in many reliability and survival analysis studies. The Weibull distribution has two parameters, the shape parameter (k) and the scale parameter (λ), which can be estimated from the data using maximum likelihood estimation or other methods.</p><p>With the Weibull distribution and failure rate function, you can estimate the mean time to failure (MTTF) and the failure rate of the system, and use them to study the reliability of the system over time.

One common method for analyzing right-censored data is the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method. By using the MLE method, you can estimate the parameters of the Weibull distribution for each component of the system, even if the data is censored.</p><p>Another method that is often used for analyzing right-censored data is the Kaplan-Meier estimator, also known as the product-limit estimator. The Kaplan-Meier estimator can be used to estimate the survival function of the system, which describes the probability that the system will survive beyond a given time. The survival function can be used to estimate the MTTF of the system, which can be used as an estimate of the system's reliability.</p><p>Finally, you could use the accelerated failure time (AFT) model, which allows to model the failure time of the system as a function of covariates.

If the p-value is less than your chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis that the sample was drawn from the theoretical distribution.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div></body></html>
