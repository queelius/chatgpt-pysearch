To her surprise, three more hands grew out of her shoulders, making her now have five hands in total.</p><p>At first, Lady Sarah was thrilled with her new appendages and she thanked the genie profusely. But soon she realized the complications that came with having five hands. She struggled to perform even the simplest of tasks and soon became a laughing stock in the kingdom. People would come from far and wide to see the "lady with five hands."</p><p>Tyrion, who had been the one to jokingly suggest the interpretation, felt guilty for his part in the misfortune that had befallen Lady Sarah. He tried to help her by finding a solution to reverse the genie's wish, but nothing worked. In the end, Lady Sarah was left to live the rest of her life as a spectacle, with five hands that brought her nothing but misery.</p><p>In this version of the story, Tyrion's role is indirect but significant.

That night, as she slept, the genie appeared before her and granted her wish of three more hands, but as a twisted joke, the genie interpreted it as three more hands on top of the two she already had, giving her a total of five.</p><p>At first, Sarah was thrilled with her newfound dexterity, but soon the weight of the extra hands became unbearable. She could no longer perform simple tasks and was ridiculed everywhere she went. Desperate for a way to reverse the genie's curse, Sarah sought out Tyrion, hoping he could find a solution.</p><p>Tyrion, who was unaware of the genie's mischief, was stunned by Sarah's appearance and felt guilty for his role in her misfortune. He used all his wit and cunning to search for a way to break the curse, but the genie was one step ahead.</p><p>In the end, Sarah was left with five hands, a constant reminder of the fateful day she crossed paths with the mischievous genie and Tyrion's jest. From then on, she lived a life of solitude, never able to shake the burden of her curse.
