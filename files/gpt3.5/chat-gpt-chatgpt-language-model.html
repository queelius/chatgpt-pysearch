In particular, we can estimate the probability of observing X[3]=x[3] and X[1]=x[1] given the context of X[2]=x[2] and X[5]=x[5] by computing P(X[3]=x[3],X[1]=x[1],X[2]=x[2],X[5]=x[5]) / P(X[2]=x[2],X[5]=x[5]).

In the context of language modeling, the goal of autoregressive modeling is to estimate the joint probability distribution of a sequence of tokens x_{1:T}, where T is the length of the sequence, and x_t is the t-th token in the sequence.</p><p>Formally, given a sequence of input tokens x_{1:t-1}, the probability of the next token x_t is modeled as a conditional probability distribution over the vocabulary V, i.e.,</p><p>P(x_t | x_{1:t-1}) = P(x_t | x_{&lt;t})</p><p>where x_{&lt;t} denotes the sequence of tokens up to (but not including) x_t.

The network is trained to minimize the negative log-likelihood loss, which is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood of the training data.</p><p>During inference, the autoregressive model generates a sequence of tokens by sampling from the estimated conditional probability distribution over the vocabulary V. Starting from an initial token (e.g., a start-of-sequence token), the model generates the next token by sampling from the estimated distribution, and then uses the updated sequence to sample the next token, and so on, until a stopping criterion (e.g., maximum sequence length or end-of-sequence token) is reached.</p><p>Autoregressive modeling has been shown to be effective for a wide range of sequence modeling tasks, including language modeling, machine translation, and image captioning, among others. However, it can be computationally expensive, especially for long sequences, and suffers from the issue of error propagation, where errors in predicting one token can affect the predictions for subsequent tokens.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">What does fine-tuning usually mean when talking about LLM like GPT-3?</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>Fine-tuning in the context of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 typically refers to the process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task or domain by further training it on a smaller, task-specific dataset.</p><p>The basic idea behind fine-tuning is that the pre-trained LLM has already learned general knowledge about language from a large, diverse corpus of text data, and this knowledge can be leveraged and adapted to specific tasks by fine-tuning the model on smaller, task-specific datasets.</p><p>The fine-tuning process involves re-training the LLM on a new, smaller dataset that is specific to the task of interest.

The hypernetwork can be trained to minimize a particular loss function, such as a weighted sum of the losses from the individual adapters.</p><p>In the case of a GPT model, we could have a final hypernetwork that takes as input the outputs of the task-specific adapters and produces a set of weights that are used to combine the outputs. The hypernetwork can be trained on a task-specific dataset to minimize a particular loss function, such as a weighted sum of the losses from the individual adapters.</p><p>The specific approach for combining the outputs of the adapters will depend on the specific task and requirements. In general, an ensemble approach may be simpler and more effective if the individual adapters are sufficiently diverse and accurate. A hypernetwork approach may be more effective if the adapters are similar in nature and require a more fine-grained control over the output combination.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">It seems like we can combine these things together, or compose them, in many ways for many purposes.

Nonetheless, there are several approaches that have been proposed for combining multiple models and adapting them to new tasks, which could potentially be used as building blocks for an AGI.</p><p>One approach is to use a hierarchical architecture that consists of multiple modules or sub-systems, each specialized for a particular task. The modules can communicate with each other and exchange information, allowing them to work together to solve complex tasks. This approach is similar to the modular architecture of the human brain, where different regions of the brain are specialized for different functions but work together to produce complex behavior.</p><p>Another approach is to use a meta-learning or reinforcement learning approach to learn how to combine multiple models or adapters to solve new tasks. In this approach, a meta-learning or reinforcement learning agent learns how to select and combine the appropriate models or adapters to solve a new task based on its experience with previous tasks. This approach is similar to how humans learn to solve new tasks based on their previous experiences and knowledge.</p><p>In the case of a GPT model, one possible approach is to use a modular architecture that consists of multiple task-specific adapters, each specialized for a particular NLP task, such as language modeling, question answering, text classification, and language translation. The adapters can be trained independently on their respective tasks and can communicate with each other to solve more complex tasks that require multiple NLP sub-tasks. The adapters can be connected through a shared memory, attention mechanism or some other mechanism that allows them to interact with each other and exchange information.</p><p>To make the system more adaptive, a meta-learning or reinforcement learning agent can be trained to learn how to select and combine the appropriate adapters based on the input and the desired output of a particular task. The agent can be trained on a diverse set of tasks to learn how to generalize to new tasks and adapt to changing environments.</p><p>The specific approach for combining task adapters and creating an AGI will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem. Nonetheless, the approaches described above provide a starting point for building more flexible, adaptable, and generalizable AI systems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div></body></html>
