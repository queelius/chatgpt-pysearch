The goal is to develop an algorithm that can automatically generate heuristics or rules for designing neural networks that perform well on a given task.</p><p>One approach to achieving this goal is to use genetic programming, which is a machine learning technique that uses evolutionary algorithms to evolve solutions to a problem. In the context of neural network design, the genetic algorithm could be used to generate and evolve a population of candidate programs or heuristics, with fitness being determined by how well the generated neural networks perform on a given task.</p><p>The self-modifying code could be used to continually modify and improve the heuristics in the population, exploring new regions of the search space and adapting to the particular problem at hand. The exploration of the search space could be guided by various heuristics, such as random mutation or crossover of heuristics, or by a more sophisticated exploration strategy based on knowledge of the problem domain.</p><p>There are, however, challenges associated with using self-modifying code for neural network design. One challenge is ensuring that the generated heuristics are correct and don't violate any constraints on the design of neural networks, such as the need for a fully connected network or the requirement for certain activation functions. Additionally, the search space for neural network design is vast, and it can be difficult to efficiently explore the space of possible heuristics.</p><p>Overall, self-modifying code is a promising approach to generating heuristics for designing neural networks, and it has the potential to produce highly effective and efficient models for a wide range of applications. However, it is an area of active research, and further developments are needed to fully realize its potential.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Genetic programming is interesting.

Lisp is a powerful programming language that is well-suited for generating and manipulating code, which makes it a natural choice for genetic programming applications. Lisp code can be easily represented as trees, which are amenable to the genetic programming crossover and mutation operators.</p><p>Regarding mutation, your suggestion of removing a predicate or adding a new one is a good starting point. In genetic programming, mutation can take many forms, such as changing a variable or function, inserting or deleting a node in a tree, or altering the structure of the tree itself. The goal of mutation is to introduce new variation into the population of programs, which can lead to improved performance on the task being optimized.</p><p>It is also important to consider the balance between exploration and exploitation when designing the mutation operator. Too much exploration can lead to a very diverse population, but may also prevent convergence to an optimal solution. On the other hand, too much exploitation can result in the population getting stuck in a local optimum. A well-designed mutation operator strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation and allows the population to explore the search space effectively while converging to a good solution.</p><p>Overall, using Lisp code as the representation for genetic programming and designing an effective mutation operator are both key factors in the success of a genetic programming approach to generating heuristics for neural network design.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">What's some recent work in this area?</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>There has been a lot of recent work in the area of using genetic programming to generate heuristics for neural network design.
