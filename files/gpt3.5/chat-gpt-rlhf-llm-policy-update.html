However, we don't want to rely solely on the LLM's predictions, as they may not always be optimal.</p><p>To improve the LLM's performance, we decide to finetune it with RLHF. We begin by collecting a set of state-action pairs from a human expert.

Action 1: "Provide the customer with their order status."</li><li>State 2: "The customer is reporting a problem with their product."

Embeddings are used in machine learning to represent the input in a way that captures its semantic meaning and allows for more efficient processing and analysis.</p><p>The construction of an embedding depends on the type of input being represented. For example, to construct an embedding for a word, we might use a technique called word embedding, where each word is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space, such that similar words are mapped to nearby vectors. One popular method for constructing word embeddings is Word2Vec, which uses a neural network to predict the context of a word given its surrounding words in a corpus.</p><p>To construct an embedding for a sentence or a document, we might use a technique called sentence embedding or document embedding, where the input is mapped to a fixed-length vector representation that captures its semantic meaning. One popular method for constructing sentence embeddings is the use of pre-trained language models like BERT or GPT-2, which are trained on large text corpora and can generate embeddings of arbitrary-length text inputs.</p><p>To construct an embedding for an image, we might use a technique called image embedding, where the input is mapped to a fixed-length vector representation that captures its visual content. One popular method for constructing image embeddings is the use of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like VGG or ResNet, which are trained on large image datasets and can generate embeddings of images by using the outputs of the intermediate layers of the network.</p><p>Overall, the construction of an embedding depends on the type of input being represented and the desired properties of the embedding, such as its dimensionality, sparsity, or semantic meaning. By constructing embeddings of inputs, we can more effectively process and analyze them in machine learning applications.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Give me an example of an embedding for "You are nice" and "You are friendly"</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>To construct embeddings for the phrases "You are nice" and "You are friendly", we can use a pre-trained language model like BERT or GPT-2 to generate fixed-length vector representations of the phrases.

One common approach is to use a sampling algorithm, such as the Gumbel-Softmax trick or beam search, to sample a token from the predicted probability distribution.</p><p>The Gumbel-Softmax trick is a sampling algorithm that generates a discrete random variable from a continuous distribution. It works by first adding random noise to the logits (the input to the softmax function) using a Gumbel distribution, and then applying the softmax function to the noisy logits to generate a probability distribution over the possible next tokens. The token with the highest probability is then selected as the predicted output.</p><p>Beam search is another commonly used sampling algorithm that generates a sequence of tokens by repeatedly selecting the token with the highest probability at each time step, while maintaining a set of multiple candidate sequences (or "beams") that are scored based on their cumulative probabilities. The algorithm terminates when one of the candidate sequences generates an end-of-sequence token or reaches a maximum length.</p><p>These sampling algorithms can be combined with a learning algorithm, such as reinforcement learning, to improve the selection of the emitted token.

The reinforcement learning algorithm learns a policy that maps from the current input and the current state of the output sequence to an action (i.e., which token to emit), such that the expected reward over the sequence of emitted tokens is maximized.</p><p>To train the reinforcement learning algorithm, we first use the neural network to generate the output probability distribution for each input.
