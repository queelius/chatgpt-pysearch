However, I can provide you with an overview of some of the most important and influential works that are essential to understand the current state of the art. Here are some key papers, in chronological order:</p><ol><li><p>"A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets" by Hinton et al. (2006)
This paper introduced the concept of deep belief networks (DBNs), a class of generative models that can be trained using unsupervised learning. The paper also proposed the contrastive divergence algorithm, which is an efficient method for training DBNs.</p></li><li><p>"Deep sparse rectifier neural networks" by Glorot et al. (2011)
This paper introduced rectified linear units (ReLU), which have become one of the most widely used activation functions in deep learning. The paper also proposed a method for initializing the weights of deep neural networks, which has been shown to improve their training.</p></li><li><p>"ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks" by Krizhevsky et al. (2012)
This paper introduced the AlexNet architecture, which was the first deep neural network to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet classification task. The paper demonstrated the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and helped to popularize the use of deep learning in computer vision.</p></li><li><p>"Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent" by Andrychowicz et al. (2016)
This paper introduced the concept of meta-learning, which involves learning to learn. The paper proposed a method for training neural networks to adapt quickly to new tasks by using a meta-objective that encourages the network to learn how to update its weights through gradient descent.</p></li><li><p>"Attention is all you need" by Vaswani et al. (2017)
This paper introduced the transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequences of data, such as natural language sentences. The transformer has become the dominant architecture for natural language processing and has been used in many state-of-the-art models.</p></li><li><p>"The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks" by Frankle and Carbin (2019)
This paper introduced the concept of the lottery ticket hypothesis, which suggests that large neural networks contain small sub-networks that are capable of achieving high performance if trained in isolation. The paper proposed a method for identifying these sub-networks and showed that they can be trained more efficiently than the original, full network.</p></li></ol><p>These are just a few examples of important papers in the field of LLMs and modern deep learning.

Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and ongoing research in meta-learning is focused on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of these methods.

Zero-shot learning is a form of meta-learning where a model is trained to recognize objects or concepts it has never seen before, by learning to map them to some kind of latent representation. The idea is to use the knowledge the model has learned from related tasks to recognize new objects or concepts without any explicit training data.</p><p>Few-shot learning is another form of meta-learning where the goal is to learn a new task from just a few examples. This is typically achieved by training a meta-learner on a variety of related tasks, so that it can learn a more general representation that is applicable to new, unseen tasks. The meta-learner is then fine-tuned on a new task with only a few examples, using the knowledge it has learned from the related tasks to adapt quickly to the new task.</p><p>Chain-of-thought prompting is a technique that can be used in the context of few-shot learning, where a language model is trained to generate examples of a new task by being prompted with a few examples and a description of the task. The idea is to use the language model's ability to generate text to create new examples of the task, which can be used to train a new model that is capable of performing the task.</p><p>Overall, meta-learning is a broad field that encompasses many different techniques and applications, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, as well as techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.

This can be done without any explicit training on examples of the new object or concept, hence the term "zero-shot."</p><p>For example, in a zero-shot image classification task, the model might be trained on a set of labeled images of animals, along with a set of attributes for each animal (e.g., "has fur," "lives in the water," "has wings," etc.). To classify a new image of an animal that is not in the training set, the model might be given a natural language description of the animal, such as "an animal with long neck, spots, and lives in the savanna." The model would then use its learned association between animals and attributes to predict the label of the new animal, such as "giraffe."</p><p>Zero-shot learning is a powerful technique because it allows a model to recognize new objects or concepts without any explicit training on examples of those objects or concepts. However, it requires careful design of the latent representation and can be challenging to apply in practice, especially when the number of possible classes is very large.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">In few short learning, does that also include where we use a LLM and, after training, when prompting it, giving it a few examples and then asking it a related question?</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>Yes, few-shot learning can involve training a language model like a large language model (LLM) and then prompting it with a few examples of a new task to generate outputs. The idea is to use the LLM's ability to generate text to create new examples of the task, which can then be used to train a new model that is capable of performing the task.</p><p>One common approach to few-shot learning with LLMs is to use a technique called prompt engineering. Prompt engineering involves designing a template prompt that can be filled in with a few examples of a new task, so that the LLM can generate outputs that are relevant to the task. For example, if the new task is to summarize a news article, the prompt might be something like "Please summarize the following article in a few sentences: [article text] [example summary 1] [example summary 2]".</p><p>Once the prompt is designed, the LLM can be fine-tuned on a few examples of the new task by prompting it with the template prompt and the examples. The LLM will generate new examples of the task based on the input, and these examples can be used to train a new model that is capable of performing the task.</p><p>This approach to few-shot learning with LLMs has shown promise in a variety of tasks, including language translation, question-answering, and sentiment analysis. However, it requires careful design of the prompt and the examples, and it can be challenging to scale to large numbers of tasks or to tasks that require more complex reasoning.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">But, it must be retrained?
