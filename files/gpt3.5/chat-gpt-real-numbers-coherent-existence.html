A key difference between classical and quantum computation is that classical computers use bits, which can exist in one of two states (0 or 1), whereas quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in a superposition of multiple states. This allows quantum computers to perform certain operations, such as factorization, exponentially faster than classical computers. However, it's important to note that not all problems can be solved faster on a quantum computer, and that quantum computers are still in the early stages of development.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Okay, so its a question of speed, but their theoretical universality is the same?</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>Quantum computers are believed to be universal for quantum computation, which means they can perform any computation that a classical computer can perform, in principle.
