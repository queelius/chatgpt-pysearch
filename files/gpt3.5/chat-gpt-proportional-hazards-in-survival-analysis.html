The assumption of proportional hazards states that the ratio of the hazard rates (i.e., the risk of the event occurring at any given time) for any two individuals is constant over time, and it does not depend on the time itself or any other covariate.</p><p>In other words, the proportional hazards assumption implies that the hazard function (i.e., the probability of experiencing the event of interest at any given time, conditional on surviving up to that time) is the same for all individuals, regardless of their covariates, but it can differ in scale between different individuals. This assumption is central to many survival models, such as the Cox proportional hazards model, which is a commonly used regression model in survival analysis.</p><p>If the proportional hazards assumption is violated, the estimates from the Cox model may be biased and unreliable. Hence, it is essential to test the proportional hazards assumption for any given dataset before fitting a Cox model. This can be done graphically by inspecting the log-log survival plot or using statistical tests, such as the Schoenfeld residuals test. If the proportional hazards assumption is not met, alternative models, such as the accelerated failure time model or the frailty model, may be used to account for the violation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">Can you show a probability equation that is true in the proportional hazards assumption?</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>Sure, here is an example of a probability equation that is true under the proportional hazards assumption:</p><p>Let T be the time to an event of interest (e.g., death) and let X be a vector of covariates that may affect the hazard rate. The proportional hazards assumption states that the hazard function h(t | X) for any two individuals with covariate vectors X and X' at time t is proportional, which can be written as:</p><p>h(t | X) / h(t | X') = λ</p><p>where λ is a constant that does not depend on time t or covariates X or X'. This equation can be rearranged as:</p><p>h(t | X) = λ * h(t | X')</p><p>or equivalently:</p><p>log[h(t | X)] = log[λ] + log[h(t | X')]</p><p>which implies that the logarithm of the hazard function is a linear function of the covariates, with a constant offset determined by log[λ].</p><p>The Cox proportional hazards model is based on this assumption and estimates the hazard ratio for each covariate in the model, which represents the multiplicative effect of that covariate on the hazard rate. The hazard ratio is constant over time and is interpreted as the relative risk of experiencing the event of interest for two individuals with covariate values that differ by one unit, while holding all other covariates constant.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">What is meant by P(candidate set is C | T = t and the cause of failure is the k-th component in C).</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>In the context of reliability analysis, the notation P(candidate set is C | T = t and the cause of failure is the k-th component in C) represents the conditional probability that a specific set of components, denoted as C, is a candidate set of failed components, given that the system has failed at time t and the cause of failure is identified as the k-th component in the set C.</p><p>More specifically, the candidate set C is a subset of the system components that could potentially have caused the system failure.

If any one component fails, the entire system fails. The lifetimes of the components in the system are typically not directly observable, and therefore, must be estimated from the available failure data.</p><p>To estimate the parameters of the hidden component lifetimes in the series system, some conditions can be applied to simplify the analysis. Here are some examples:</p><ol><li><p>Identical components: If all components in the series system are identical and have the same lifetime distribution, the estimation of the parameters becomes simpler. In this case, the lifetime distribution of the system can be modeled as the convolution of the component lifetime distribution. The parameters of the component lifetime distribution can be estimated by analyzing the failure data of the system.</p></li><li><p>Independent components: If the components in the series system are independent, then the lifetime distribution of the system can be modeled as the minimum of the component lifetimes. In this case, the parameters of the component lifetime distributions can be estimated separately by analyzing the failure data of each component. The overall system reliability can be calculated by using the estimated parameters.</p></li><li><p>Common-cause failures: If the components in the series system are subject to common-cause failures, such as environmental factors, then the lifetimes of the components may not be independent. In this case, the estimation of the parameters can be more complex. One approach is to use the Bayesian method and incorporate expert knowledge to model the common-cause failures.</p></li><li><p>Degradation modeling: If the system components degrade over time, the estimation of the parameters of the component lifetimes can be challenging. In this case, the degradation process of the components can be modeled, and the estimation of the parameters can be based on the degradation models.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, the conditions applied to the model for estimating the parameters of the hidden component lifetimes in the series system depend on the characteristics of the system and the available data. Identifying the appropriate conditions and using appropriate modeling techniques can simplify the estimation process and improve the accuracy of the results.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap">How about P(C | T = t, K = k) = P(C | T = t, K = j), where C is the candidate set, t is the observed system lifetime (of the series system of m components), and K is the discrete random variable for the failed component.</div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>The expression P(C | T = t, K = k) = P(C | T = t, K = j) implies that the probability of a candidate set C being the true set of failed components, given that the system has failed at time t and the failed component is identified as the k-th component in the set C, is the same for any value of j. In other words, the conditional probability of C is independent of the identity of the failed component, given the system lifetime and the candidate set.</p><p>This assumption is called the homogeneity assumption, and it is often made in reliability analysis to simplify the estimation of the candidate set probabilities. The homogeneity assumption implies that the failure probabilities of the system components are equal, and any one of them is equally likely to be the cause of the system failure.

In this case, a heuristic algorithm, such as the binary search algorithm or genetic algorithm, can be used to efficiently search for the most likely candidate sets.</p><p>However, it is worth noting that the homogeneity assumption may not hold in many real-world systems, where the failure probabilities of the components may be different due to variations in operating conditions, quality control, or other factors.

One common approach is to use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, which involves finding the values of theta[j] that maximize the likelihood function of the observed data.</p><p>The likelihood function for a single observation (C, T) can be expressed as:</p><p>L(theta[j] | C, T) = ∏(i∈C,i≠j) [1 - F_i(T; theta[i])] * F_j(T; theta[j])</p><p>where F_i(T; theta[i]) is the CDF of the lifetime of component i, given the parameter vector theta[i], and F_j(T; theta[j]) is the CDF of the lifetime of component j, given the parameter vector theta[j].</p><p>The MLE of the parameter vector theta[j] is the value that maximizes the likelihood function L(theta[j] | C, T), which can be found by solving the equation:</p><p>d/dtheta[j] L(theta[j] | C, T) = 0</p><p>where d/dtheta[j] denotes the partial derivative with respect to theta[j].</p><p>The solution to this equation can be found numerically using optimization techniques, such as the Newton-Raphson method, the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method, or the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. These methods can efficiently estimate the parameter vector theta[j] from the available data, even when the number of components and the complexity of the lifetime distribution are high.</p><p>It is worth noting that the MLE method assumes that the candidate sets are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and the lifetime distributions of the components are known. If these assumptions do not hold, alternative estimation methods, such as the Bayesian method or the non-parametric method, may be required. Additionally, the MLE method may not work well when the sample size is small or the observed data is censored. In such cases, alternative methods, such as the method of moments or the maximum likelihood estimator with data augmentation, may be more appropriate.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"></div></div></div></div></body></html>
